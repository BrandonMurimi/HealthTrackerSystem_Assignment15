This reflection summarizes my experience contributing to different peer repositories as part of Assignment 15: Cross-Project Collaboration.

##  Key Learnings

###  Cross-Project Adaptation
Each project had a unique structure and workflow, which helped me adapt quickly and understand different documentation and architectural styles. I learned how to explore unfamiliar repositories and identify good entry points for contribution.

###  Testing and CI/CD
The use of GitHub Actions in all peer repositories reinforced the importance of automated testing and CI pipelines. I gained experience debugging test failures caused by environment configuration and how PR feedback loops are enhanced with automated checks.

###  Documentation Contributions
Improving README files helped me realize the role clear documentation plays in onboarding new developers. Writing concise and helpful docs is an underrated skill that bridges the gap between users and maintainers.

##  Challenges Faced

- **Time Coordination**: Waiting for feedback or review approval was sometimes slow and required follow-ups.
- **Scoping Contributions**: Avoiding over-scoping or solving too many things in a single PR was a learning curve.
- **CI Failures**: I experienced one test failure due to inconsistent config files, which taught me to verify all changes locally first.

##  Takeaways

- Contribution etiquette (commenting on issues, submitting clean commits) is just as important as code.
- Every small PR adds value â€” especially tests, docs, and refactors.
- The open-source model is powerful because it relies on transparency, review, and accountability.
